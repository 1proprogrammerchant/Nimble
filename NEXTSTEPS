NimbleLedger
-------------
1. Maintain the log in Azure storage and expose NimbleLedger APIs

2. Support for multiple endorsers
  * Coordinator interacts with endorsers over RPCs or using queues
  * Support for introducing new endorsers 

3. Low-TCB endorsers
  * Option#1: Xingyang's and Weidong's enclave runtime 
    Pro: Lowest TCB
    Con: We need FFI to interact with enclave code

  * Option#2: Extend Fortanix's enclave-runner to shed dependency on Rust's std
    Pro: Fully Rust-based
    Con: Might not be lowest TCB


NimbleIndex: An index atop NimbleLedger
---------------------------------------
  * lookup by the index of the entry in the ledger
  * lookup by a secondary index (i.e., a field in the entry)

NimbleHDFS
----------
TBD. Q: What extensions do we need here?
